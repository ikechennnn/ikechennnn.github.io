                        <p>When we thinking about a country's development, the most direct data that most people use will be GDP. However, military spending is also another factor that can reflect one country's level of development.

                    <p>
                        The visualization is a scatter plot with X axis represent year, y axis represent military spending or GDP, and circle size represent population. <b>Click the button can switch between military spending and GDP</b>. From the trend, it is easy to notice that the military spending is increasing as the GDP increasing as well as the increasing population. However, when look into the Military spending graph, there are some period that GDP is increasing but the military spending is decrease instead. It can be predict that there are some other factors that affect the military spending.

                    <p>
                        From the visualization we can learn that although GDP, population and military spending are increase together, there still some period that military spending is decreased caused by other factors. Those factors that I can think about will be the period after war, the adjustment made by new president, and economic focus shifting. Those are can be potention factors but we still need to look into history context and data if we want to learn more about military spending.
